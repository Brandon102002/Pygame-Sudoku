## Usage Guide

There is a default board loaded. To edit it, you can click or use arrow keys to select a box, then type a number.
If a placement is invalid, you will be prevented from placing the number there.

- Press "R" to reset the board back to its default state
- Press "C" to clear the board to test other boards
- Press "Enter" at any time to begin the auto-solve process
